### Key Concepts

- **CIA Triad**  
  A core model in information security, representing three primary goals:

  - **Confidentiality**: Ensuring that sensitive information is accessible only to authorized individuals.  
  - **Integrity**: Guaranteeing the accuracy and trustworthiness of data and systems.  
  - **Availability**: Making sure that systems and data are accessible when needed by authorized users.

- **Least Privilege**  
  Users, applications, and systems should be granted the **minimum level of access** necessary to perform their functions. This reduces the potential impact of errors or breaches.

- **Defense in Depth**  
  A strategy that employs **multiple layers of security controls** throughout an IT system. If one layer fails, others continue to provide protection, reducing the overall risk.

- **Separation of Duties**  
  Splitting responsibilities among individuals or systems to prevent **fraud, error, or abuse of power**. For example, the person who approves financial transactions should not also be the one executing them.
